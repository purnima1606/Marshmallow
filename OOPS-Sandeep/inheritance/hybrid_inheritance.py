While looking up for spam() from child3 in multiple inheritance,
 * Child3 will be searched first and then Child1 class will be searched
 * But super() in Child2 will not call the parent class of Child1, but it 
   will consider the next class in mro(i.e., Child2) as super() class 
 * Child2 will be checked for presence of spam() if it not present then
   finally from Child2 it will go to Parent class.
